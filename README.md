# Professional-Networking
## How important networking is  
While completing my diploma in Communication Networks, I understood the importance of building meaningful professional connections to open up career opportunities. 
A closed friend who was already working in the tech industry informed me about an opening for a trainee position at a local repair centre that he worked at so I reached out, expressed my interest and after sharing my academic background and willingness to learn, I was introduced to the hiring manager.
This connection played a key role in helping me secure the trainee position, where I was able to apply my theoretical knowledge in a real-world environment. 
Later, when I was looking to transition into a more specialized IT role, I took a more proactive approach by leveraging LinkedIn. 
I updated my profile, highlighted my hands-on experience from the repair centre, and began engaging with IT professionals and job postings where eventually I came across an opportunity for a First Line Service Desk Analyst role. 
I applied and after a successful 3 round interview process, I was offered the position. 
These experiences showed me that professional networking whether through personal connections or digital platforms is a powerful tool in progressing your career and accessing opportunities that might not be publicly visible.
These experiences really changed my perspective in regards to the tech industry.
